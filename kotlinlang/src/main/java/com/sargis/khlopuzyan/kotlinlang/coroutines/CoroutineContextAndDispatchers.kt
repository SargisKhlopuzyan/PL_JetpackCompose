/**
 * - (1) interface Job : CoroutineContext.Element
 *
 * - (2) launch is a coroutine builder
 * - (3) runBlocking is also a coroutine builder that bridges the non-coroutine world of a regular fun main() and the code with coroutines
 *
 * - (4) A CoroutineScope in Kotlin defines the lifecycle and context for coroutines launched within it.
 *       It acts as a container or parent for coroutines, managing their execution and cancellation.
 *
 * - (5) Coroutines follow a principle of structured concurrency which means that new coroutines can
 *       only be launched in a specific CoroutineScope which delimits the lifetime of the coroutine
 *
 * - (6) *** Scope builder *** In addition to the coroutine scope provided by different builders,
 *   it is possible to declare your own scope using the coroutineScope builder.
 *   It creates a coroutine scope and does not complete until all launched children complete
 *
 * - (7) async is just like launch.
 *       It starts a separate coroutine which is a light-weight thread that works concurrently with all the other coroutines.
 *       The difference is that launch returns a Job and does not carry any resulting value, while async returns a
 *       Deferred â€” a light-weight non-blocking future that represents a promise to provide a result later.
 *       You can use .await() on a deferred value to get its eventual result, but Deferred is also a Job, so you can cancel it if needed.
